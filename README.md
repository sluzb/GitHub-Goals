What am I here for?

I'm here to learn about coding.
I'm here to be a better student, a better learner, and a better person.
I'm here to expand my skillset.
I'm here to help myself find a career that I love.
I'm here to be cognizant of technology's impact on this changing world.
I'm here so I don't become obsolete.
